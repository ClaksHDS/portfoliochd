### Styling tools

>

- Open Peeps(https://pablostanley.gumroad.com/l/openpeeps?wanted=true&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openpeeps.com%2F) : a hand-drawn illustration library used in Figma to create all the illustrations and logo.
- Happy Hues (https://www.happyhues.co/) : to create a nice color palette.
- Contrast checker to be sure that the color palette was respecting the rules of accessibility : this one (https://marijohannessen.github.io/color-contrast-checker/) and this one by Adobe Color (https://color.adobe.com/fr/create/color-contrast-analyzer)

### Management tools

>

- **Figma** to wireframe the application and visualize the end result on smaller and bigger screens. I also create the logo and illustrations with Figma.
  >
- **GithubDesktop** to handle version control.
  >
- **Trello** to create a board with a checklist of all the different steps of the project, and plan my work.
  >

### Features

> There is a **light and dark theme switch**. It offers a nice touch to the user who can select the theme he/she is the most comfortable with.
> A hamburger menu that opens a **sidebar on small devices**.
> When you scroll down, a button appears and allows you to **scroll back to the top**. It's an easier way to access again the menu or sidebar.
